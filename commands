WhatsApp-Specific Notes
For --notify in CLI add command, use international format (e.g., +1234567890).
WhatsApp Web must be open and logged in on your default browser.
pywhatkit will open the browser tab automatically and send the message.

Dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format.
Database (expenses.db) is created automatically on first run.
Use --help with any CLI command for more details, e.g., python main.py cli add --help.
For API testing, use tools like Postman or curl as shown.
